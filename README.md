# vault-plugin-secrets-oauthapp

This is a standalone backend plugin for use with [HashiCorp
Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault).

This plugin provides a secure wrapper around OAuth 2 authorization code, refresh
token, device code, and client credentials grant types, allowing a Vault client
to request authorization on behalf of a user and perform actions using a
negotiated OAuth 2 access token.

## Usage

Once you have the binary, you will need to register the plugin with Vault.
Follow [the instructions in the Vault
documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/plugins.html#plugin-registration)
to add the plugin to the catalog. We will assume it is registered under the name
`oauthapp`.

Enable the plugin at the path of your choosing:

```
$ vault secrets enable -path=oauth2 oauthapp
Success! Enabled the oauthapp secrets engine at: oauth2/
```

Configure it with the necessary information to exchange tokens:

```
$ vault write oauth2/servers/github-puppetlabs \
    provider=github \
    client_id=aBcD3FgHiJkLmN0pQ \
    client_secret=AbCd3fGh1jK1MnoPqRs7uVwXYz
Success! Data written to: oauth2/servers/github-puppetlabs
```

Once the client secret has been written, it will never be exposed again.

You can have as many server configurations as you need for your use case,
although it is common to only have one. Server configurations need not share the
same provider.

### Authorization code exchange flow

From a Vault client, request an authorization code URL:

```
$ vault write oauth2/auth-code-url \
    server=github-puppetlabs \
    state=foo \
    scopes=bar,baz
Key    Value
---    -----
url    https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=aBcD3FgHiJkLmN0pQ&response_type=code&scope=bar+baz&state=foo
```

If you don't specify a state value, the plugin will generate one for you and return it in the response as well.

After redirecting the user to that URL and receiving the resulting temporary
authorization code in your callback handler, you can create a permanent
credential that automatically refreshes:

```
$ vault write oauth2/creds/my-user-auth \
    server=github-puppetlabs \
    code=zYxWvU7sRqP
Success! Data written to: oauth2/creds/my-user-auth
```

Assuming the refresh token remains valid, an access token is available any time at the same endpoint:

```
$ vault read oauth2/creds/my-user-auth
Key             Value
---             -----
access_token    nLlBg9Lmd7n1X96bw/xcW9HvyOHzxj19z3zXKv0XXxr8eLjQSerf4iyPDRCucSHQN+c7fnKhPsSWbWg0
server          github-puppetlabs
type            Bearer
```

Note that the client secret and refresh token are never exposed to Vault
clients.

Alternatively, if a refresh token is obtained in some other way you can
skip the auth code URL step and pass the token directly to the creds
write instead of the response code:

```
$ vault write oauth2/creds/my-user-auth \
    server=github-puppetlabs \
    grant_type=refresh_token \
    refresh_token=TGUgZ3JpbGxlPw==
Success! Data written to: oauth2/creds/my-user-auth
```

### Device code flow

The [device code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/device-code/) grant type
allows a user to authenticate outside of a browser session. This plugin supports
the device code flow and automatically handles polling the authorization server
for a valid access token.

Not all providers support device code grants. Check the provider's documentation for more information.

To initiate the device code flow:

```
$ vault write oauth2/creds/my-user-auth \
    server=github-puppetlabs \
    grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code
Key                 Value
---                 -----
expire_time         2021-03-10T23:35:00.295229233Z
user_code           BDWD-HQPK
verification_uri    https://github.com/login/device
```

The plugin will manage the device code (similar to a refresh token) and will
never present it to you. You should forward the user code and verification URL
to the authorization subject for them to take action to log in.

Initially, when you try to read the credential back, you'll get an error letting
you know the token is pending issuance because the user hasn't yet performed the
required verification steps:

```
$ vault read oauth2/creds/my-user-auth
Error reading oauth2/creds/my-user-auth: Error making API request.

URL: GET http://localhost:8200/v1/oauth2/creds/my-user-auth
Code: 400. Errors:

* token pending issuance
```

However, within a few seconds of the user verifying their identity, you should
see the access token:

```
$ vault read oauth2/creds/my-user-auth
Key             Value
---             -----
access_token    aGVsbG8gaGVsbG8gaGVsbG8K
expire_time     2021-03-27T00:15:38.72796606Z
server          github-puppetlabs
type            Bearer
```

### Client credentials flow

From a Vault client, configure a server that supports the client credentials
grant type and write a credential under the `self` endpoint that references the
server:

```
$ vault write oauth2/servers/auth0-example \
    provider=oidc \
    provider_options=issuer_url=https://dev-example.us.auth0.com/ \
    client_id=aBcD3FgHiJkLmN0pQ \
    client_secret=AbCd3fGh1jK1MnoPqRs7uVwXYz
Success! Data written to: oauth2/servers/auth0-example
```
```
$ vault write oauth2/self/my-machine-auth \
    server=auth0-example \
    token_url_params=audience=https://dev-example.us.auth0.com/api/v2/ \
    scopes=read:users
Success! Data written to: oauth2/self/my-machine-auth
```

The token will be negotiated on demand going forward using the desired
configuration:

```
$ vault read oauth2/self/my-machine-auth
Key                 Value
---                 -----
access_token        SSBhbSBzbyBzbWFydC4gUy1NLVItVC4=
expire_time         2021-01-16T15:38:21.105335834Z
scopes              [read:users]
server              auth0-example
token_url_params    map[audience:https://dev-example.us.auth0.com/api/v2/]
type                Bearer
```

## Tips

For some operations, you may find that you need to provide a map of data for a
field. When using the Vault CLI, you can repeat the name of the field for each
key-value pair of the map and use `=` to separate keys from values. For example:

```
$ vault write oauth2/servers/oidc-example \
    provider_options=issuer_url=https://login.example.com \
    provider_options=extra_data_fields=id_token_claims
```

## Upgrading

For instructions on how to upgrade from previous versions of the plugin, see the
[UPGRADING](UPGRADING.md) document.

## Performance tuning

There are several categories of performance tuning options you may want to
adjust to get the most out of this plugin. All of the options are fields set
when writing this plugin's configuration to the `config` endpoint.

### Provider timeouts

It can be inconvenient when a provider you're working with doesn't respond to
requests in a reasonable time. Therefore, we apply a default timeout of 30
seconds to all outbound requests. We also allow for a bit of leeway when a token
is getting close to its expiry, preferring to wait longer to avoid clients
having to retry requests to Vault. This is applied using a logarithmic algorithm
relative to the usual grace period we'd use for refreshing.

You can set the initial provider timeout using the
`tune_provider_timeout_seconds` option. If you set it to 0, we won't apply any
timeout.

The default leeway factor is 1.5, i.e., a maximum timeout of 45 seconds when a
token is close to expiration. You can set a different factor using the
`tune_provider_timeout_expiry_leeway_factor` option. To disable timeout scaling,
set the leeway factor to 1.

### Automatic refreshing

To avoid having to contact providers when tokens are read from storage and need
to be refreshed, this plugin will automatically check and attempt to refresh
tokens that are close to expiring on a regular interval. The default check
interval is 1 minute. The refresh check has a grace period, called the expiry
delta, that extends beyond the refresh check interval to allow for some overlap.
The default expiry delta factor is 1.2, or 72 seconds.

You can set the refresh check interval using the
`tune_refresh_check_interval_seconds` option and the expiry delta factor using
the `tune_refresh_expiry_delta_factor` option.

If you don't need this behavior, for example because your provider doesn't use
refresh tokens, you can set `tune_refresh_check_interval_seconds` to 0.

Alternatively, if you have a relatively small number of tokens and your provider
issues tokens with very long expirations, you may want to use a longer refresh
interval than the default to avoid having to loop over all credentials in
storage every minute.

### Automatic reaping

There are a number of situations that result in stored tokens becoming unusable.
Broadly, we group these into the following categories:

* Expired with no refresh token
* Expired and refresh failed because the provider rejected the refresh request
* Expired and enough transient errors have occurred to discard the token (for
  example, instead of rejecting a token, the provider hangs the connection)

This plugin can automatically delete tokens that are expired and meet one of
these criteria using a process called reaping. Like the automatic refreshing,
reaping runs on an interval, by default 5 minutes. You can change the reap
interval using the `tune_reap_check_interval_seconds` option.

You can disable the reaper entirely by setting the option to 0, or you can
enable a dry run mode using the `tune_reap_dry_run` option. When in dry run
mode, you can check your Vault server logs to see which credentials would be
deleted.

The criteria are mutually exclusive, so for example, a token that has a provider
refresh rejection will always have that criterion applied to it, even if it also
has transient errors.

Each of the criteria have their own tuning options documented in the `config`
endpoint. Note that the defaults should be reasonable for most users. You can
disable any of the criteria by setting its corresponding option to 0.

## Endpoints

### `config`

#### `GET` (`read`)

Retrieve the current configuration settings.

#### `PUT` (`write`)

Write new configuration settings. This endpoint completely replaces the existing
configuration, so you must specify all desired fields, even when updating.

Parameters:

#### `DELETE` (`delete`)

Remove the current configuration, resetting tuning options to the plugin
defaults.

### `servers/:name`

#### `GET` (`read`)

Retrieve the configuration for a given server (except the client secret).

#### `PUT` (`write`)

Create or update the configuration for a given server.

Parameters:

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| `client_id` | The OAuth 2.0 client ID. | String | None | Yes |
| `client_secret` | The OAuth 2.0 client secret. | String | None | No |
| `auth_url_params` | A map of additional query string parameters to provide to the authorization code URL. | Map of String🠦String | None | No |

#### `DELETE` (`delete`)

Remove the configuration for a given server. Note that this does not revoke any
stored credentials that reference the server name, but those credentials will no
longer be able to be updated automatically.

If you write a new server configuration with the same name, existing credentials
that reference the server will start to use it.

### `auth-code-url`

#### `PUT` (`write`)

Retrieve an authorization code URL for the given server. Some providers may not
provide the plugin with information about this URL, in which case accessing this
endpoint will return an error.

This operation does not change any underlying storage, but because the state
parameter is sensitive, we use a write operation and include it in the request
body to prevent proxies from inadvertently logging it.

Parameters:

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| `server` | The name of a server to use for the authorization code exchange flow. | String | None<sup id="ret-2-a">[2](#footnote-2)</sup> | Yes |
